# UI Refresh Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to confirm key experiences reflect saved changes immediately without logging out or hard-refreshing.

## Staff Profile & Access
- Edit staff profile details (name, campus, permissions) and save.
- Confirm profile panel and user lists update instantly.
- Switch to a staff role with changed permissions and confirm navigation items reflect new access without re-login.

## Admin Records
- Create a new admin-side record (task, announcement, or report) and ensure the respective list shows the entry right away.
- Update an existing record and verify the list row reflects the change without a manual refresh.
- Delete a record and confirm it disappears from the list instantly.

## Student Roster
- Add a student and confirm they appear in roster and class filters immediately.
- Update a student’s class/arm assignment and verify the change in roster and detail view.
- Remove a student and ensure they no longer appear in roster searches.

## Payroll & Leave
- Adjust payroll details or run payroll and confirm totals/statuses update in the payroll views immediately.
- Approve/decline a leave request and verify status updates across both approver and requester views without reloading.
