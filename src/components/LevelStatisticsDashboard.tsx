I need to see the current file content to make this change accurately. However, since you've provided specific details about the move, I'll describe what needs to happen:

1. Remove the `isActiveStudent` function from around line 366
2. Insert it after `calculateGradeDistribution` (around line 110) and before `buildScopeForClass`

Could you please provide the full file content, or would you like me to proceed with a different approach?
